Title : Marine Life Conservation and Ocean Pollution

Problem Statement: To find a solution to the harm caused by littering, plastic, oil spills and ocean mining to aquatic life and ocean water.

Introduction:  
Oceans are the largest water bodies on the planet Earth. Over the last few decades, excessive human activities have severely affected marine life on the Earth’s oceans. Ocean pollution, also known as marine pollution, is the spreading of harmful substances such as oil, plastic, industrial and agricultural waste and chemical particles into the ocean. Ocean pollution has many consequences that directly and indirectly affect marine life, as well as humans.

Since oceans provide the home to a wide variety of marine animals and plants, it is the responsibility of every citizen to play his or her part in making these oceans clean so that marine species can thrive for a longer period of time.

Solution: 
Given the long-term, disastrous effects of ocean pollution, anything we can do to avoid contaminating our seas is a good idea. Here are some ocean pollution solutions that can make a big difference.

Reduce chemical fertilizer use and use organic farming and sanitation methods.
Opt for reusable bottles and utensils besides throwing them away.
Organize a social distancing cleanup at the beach.
Reduce use of ocean extracted materials.

The above mentioned are some solutions we all can follow to make our ocean breathe oxygen without any complications. But after thinking on this topic we came up with an innovative gadget idea which would help to clean marine pollution. 

The gadget is named “AQUA”. It will help you with the marine pollution caused.

Principle: The device which we can use here has a type of suction and works on Archimedes Principle of Buoyancy and it doesn't harm any marine life. There is also a suction for the waste products to be sucked  in the machine so that we remove the pollutants.
Working: The device has 3 main different sections namely Barrier, Suction and Power Supply. 
The Barrier- The device has a barrier which floats on the sea water which collects the pollutants. It even contains a net which just floats over the surface of sea water so the light weight solid waste which floats are collected. It acts like a fence to prevent the oil from further spreading or floating away.
The Suction- The device even contains a suction which sucks all the waste gathered by the barrier section and accumulates it into different sections which keeps the waste separated, further it is recycled. 
The Power- The device works on 2 different energies that is the tidal energy and the solar energy. The waves which are created by the sea water are used to create the electricity for the suction and working of the device. Similarly there are also solar panels on the device because during the day time there is a lot of sunlight which falls on the device and this can be also used to generate electricity. This also makes the device more eco friendly.
